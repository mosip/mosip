Modular Open Source Identity Platform or [MOSIP](https://mosip.io/#1) was incubated at IIIT-Bangalore as a global [Digital Public Good](https://github.com/DPGAlliance). The platform enables digital-identity-led development and transformation for countries. Our vision is to help build a digital future that is inter-operable, inclusive, and based on trust.
 
MOSIP offers adopters the flexibility to design, build, and own critical software infrastructure for ID. The open-source and open-standard platform comes with a modular, configurable, and customisable architecture, built on the principles of security and privacy by design. 
 
With MOSIP, adopters can imagine digital ID as a foundational building block for governance, enabling greater access to government-to-citizen services. Funded by philanthropic capital, the platform is being adopted by 20 countries in the Asia Pacific, Africa, and Latin America.
